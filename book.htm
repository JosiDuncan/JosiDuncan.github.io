<h2>The Apple Dumpling</H2>
<P>ONCE UPON A TIME there was an old woman named Hazel.  More than anything, she loved to eat an apple dumpling for dinner. One day, Hazel said, “I will bake an apple dumpling tonight!” 
</P>
<P>
Looking about, she said, “I have plenty of flour.  I have plenty of butter.  I have plenty of sugar. And I have plenty of spice.  Why, I could make ten apple dumplings if I wanted to!”  Then all of a sudden, she stopped.  “Oh, dear!” she said. “I have no apples!”
</P>
<P>
In the old woman’s back yard was a tree full of plums.  You never saw more plums as round and red than the plums on that tree.  But you cannot make an apple dumpling with plums, and there is no use trying!
</P>

<P>
Hazel could not stop thinking about her apple dumpling.  At last, she had an idea.  She took her basket out to her back yard and filled it with plums.  She covered the basket with a white cloth and hung it on her arm.  She said, “There may be those in the world who have apples, and who need plums.”  And so Hazel went out the door.
</P>
<P>
Before long, Hazel came to a yard with many hens and many geese. What a noise they made!  Ca-ca, quawk, quawk!  In the middle of all these birds there was a young woman.  She was feeding them corn, and she waved to Hazel.  Hazel waved back to her.
</P>
 
<P>
The young woman told Hazel about her hens and geese.  Hazel told the young woman about her plums, and how she hoped to trade them for apples.  If only she could trade her plums for apples, she might have an apple dumpling that night.
</P>
<P>
“Ah!” said the young woman when she heard this. “Those are lovely plums in your basket.  And there is nothing my family likes better with goose than plum jelly!  But I have no apples to trade for your plums.”  She said, “The best I can give to trade with you is a bag of feathers.  Will you take my feathers for your plums?”
</P>
<P>
“Well, it is not apples," thought Hazel. “But why not?  One person happy is better than two who do not have what they want.” The old woman poured the plums into the young woman's apron.  She took the bag of feathers, put it in her basket, and went on her way.
</P>
<P>
Hazel said, “Maybe I am no closer to an apple dumpling than I was before.  But at least I am no farther away.  And feathers are easier to carry than plums - that's for sure!”
</P>
<P>
Trudge, trudge, up a hill and down.  Past a farm, past a brook.  Then such a lovely smell filled the air.  “Ah!” Hazel said as she came up to a garden gate.  Roses, lilies, lilacs - never before had she seen such a garden gate.
</P>
<P>
From the garden inside, Agnes heard the sounds of a man and a woman talking loudly.  And they were not happy.
</P>
<P>
"Cotton!" said the woman.
</P>
<P>
"Straw!" said the man.
</P>
<P>
So they went, back and forth.  Then the two of them saw Hazel at the gate.
</P>
<P>
“Here is someone who can help us decide,” said the woman.  She opened the gate. “Good mother,” she said. “If you were making a cushion for your grandfather’s arm chair, would you not stuff it with cotton?”
</P>
<P>
“Cotton?  I do not think I would,” said Hazel.
</P>
<P>
“I told you so!” cried the man. “Straw is the very thing.  And you need to go no farther than the barn for it.”  But Hazel shook her head.  “Nor would I stuff the cushion with straw.”
</P>
<P>


“Oh!” said the man and woman.  They did not know what to think!  Hazel took out the bag of feathers very fast.  “I have something better,” she said.  “Here! A cushion stuffed with feathers is fit for a king!”
</P>
<P>

“Feathers!” said the man. 
</P>
<P>
"What a fine cushion we can make with these!" said the woman.  They were very happy, and asked what they could give the old woman in return.
</P>
<P>
“If you must know, apples would be just the thing,” said Hazel.  “That is what I am looking for.”
</P>
<P>
“Ah, we have no apples!” said the man. 
</P>
<P>
“At least, let us give you something for the feathers,” said the woman. 
</P>
<P>
The man and woman cut one flower here, and another there.  Soon there were more lovely flowers than their arms could hold.  Never was there a sweeter bunch of flowers!  They handed the armful of flowers to Hazel.
</P>
<P>

“A good bargain," said Hazel, "and not all of it in the basket.” For she was glad that the two young people were now happy with each other.  She wished them both well, and went on her way.
</P>
<P>
Soon Hazel came upon a young lord, dressed in very fine clothes and with a gold chain around his neck.  But such a frown on his face!  He looked as if he had no friend left in the whole wide world.
</P>
<P>
“A fair day and a good road, my lord,” said Hazel.
</P>
<P>
“Fair day? Good road?" said he. “Maybe for you!  But for me, the court jeweler did not finish the ring I gave him to make.  Now I must go to my lady love with nothing in my hands to give her.”
</P>
<P>
“Is that what is the matter?” said the old woman.  “Then you shall have a gift for your lady!” Hazel handed the flowers from her basket to the young lord.  “Though I may never have an apple dumpling!”  The flowers made the lord so glad that he smiled from ear to ear.
</P>
<P>
The young lord said, “A fair trade is no robbery.”  He took the gold chain from around his neck and put it around Hazel's neck.  The young lord skipped away, holding the flowers to his chest.
</P>
<P>
“A gold chain!” cried Hazel. “With this, I can buy all the apples in the king’s market and have coins left to spare!” She hurried to town as fast as her feet could go.
</P>
<P>
But Hazel had gone no more than the turn of the road when she came upon a mother and her children, standing in a doorway.  Their faces were as sad as her own was happy.
</P>
<P>

"What is the matter?" she asked, as soon as she reached them.
</P>
<P>
“Matter enough,” answered the mother, “when the last crust of bread is eaten and not a coin left in the house to buy more.”
</P>
<P>
“What a day!” cried Hazel. “I cannot think of eating an apple dumpling for supper while those near me have no bread.” She put the gold chain into the mother’s hands and rushed off.
</P>
<P>
But the mother and children, every one of them laughing and happy, ran up to her.
</P>
<P>
“We have little to give you,” said the mother. “But here is a little dog.  His barking will keep loneliness from your house and our thanks goes with it.”

 </P>
<P>
The old woman did not have the heart to tell them "no." So into the basket went the little dog, and very snugly he lay there.
</P>
<P>
“A bag of feathers for a basket of plums. A bunch of flowers for a bag of feathers.  A golden chain for a bunch of flowers.  And a dog for a golden chain.  All the world is give and take, and who knows if I may have my apple dumpling yet,” said Hazel as she hurried on.
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Hazel had not gone a half dozen yards when, right before her eyes, she saw an apple tree as full of apples as her very own plum tree was full of plums. This apple tree grew in front of a house as much like her own as if they were two peas in the same pod.  And on the porch of the house sat a little old man.
</P>
<P>
“That is a fine tree of apples you have!” said the old woman as soon as she was close enough to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
“Aye,” said the old man.  “But apple trees and apples are poor company when a man is growing old. I would give them all if I had even so much as a little dog to bark on my door-step.”
</P>
<P>

“Bow-wow,” barked the dog in the old woman’s basket.  And in less time than it takes to read the end of this story, the little dog was barking on the old man’s door-step.  And Hazel was on her way home with a basket full of apples.
</P>
<P>
“If you try long enough and hard enough, you can always have an apple dumpling for supper,” said Hazel.  
</P>
<P>

That night she baked herself a delicious apple dumpling, and ate it down to the very last crumb.

<div align="center"><h2>A New Kind of Fun</h2>
<p>
A certain German nobleman provided his son with a tutor whose duty it was to cultivate the mind and morals of the youth.
</p>
<p>
One day as the tutor and his pupil were taking a walk in the country, they came to the edge of a wood, where they observed a half-felled tree, and saw lying by it a pair of wooden shoes. The day being warm, the workman, resting from his toil, was cooling his feet in a neighboring brook. The young nobleman, in a spirit of fun, picked up a few small rounded pebbles and said: “I’ll put these in the old fellow’s shoes, and we’ll enjoy his grimaces when he tries to put them on. It will be great fun.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the tutor, “I doubt if you will get much fun out of that. He must be a poor man. No doubt his lot is a hard one. Would there be fun in adding to his troubles? I can’t help thinking that if you were to surprise him in a different way, say by putting a little money in each shoe, you would enjoy his grimaces better. You have plenty of money. What do you say? Is it worth trying?”
</p>
<p>
The boy who, though mischievous, was very kind-hearted and generous, caught quickly at the proposal of the tutor, and slipped a silver coin into each shoe. Then they hid behind a tree to watch the outcome of their innocent prank. They had not very long to wait. An elderly man came back to his work—hard work it was, too hard for a man of his years—and slipped his right foot into his shoe.
</p>
<p>
Feeling something hard in the shoe he withdrew his foot and looked to see what the object might be, when lo! he discovered the coin. A look of puzzled amazement came over his sad face, which made the two watchers chuckle with amusement. He turned the coin over and over in his hand, and gazed at it in astonishment.
</p>
<p>
As he looked at it he felt with his foot for the other shoe, and slipped that one on. To his great surprise that shoe, too, held a coin. Holding up both silver pieces, and staring at them in silence, he made a most impressive picture, which was by no means lost upon the two beholders. Then suddenly clasping his hands together he fell upon his knees and gave thanks for the blessing that had come upon him.
</p>
<p>
As he prayed, the boy and his tutor learned from his words that his poor wife was sick and helpless at home, and that his orphaned grandchildren were suffering for food, while he, old and feeble, was striving by heavy toil to earn a crust. The old man invoked the blessing of Heaven upon the unknown but generous soul who had pitied his poverty—the kind heart, whosoever it might be, that could thus beat warm in charity and kindness for the hungry and the poor.
</p>
<p>
“He has gone,” said the old man, “without even waiting to be thanked. But go where he may, far as he may, the earth is not wide enough but that the blessing of an old man shall seek him out and find him. The blessing of the poor flies fast,” he cried; “it will overtake him and abide with him to the end of life.
</p>
<p>
“May the charity of God and the care of His angels go with him, keep him from poverty, shield him from sickness, guard him from evil, and ever fill his heart with warmth and joy, as he has filled mine this day! I’ll work no more today. I’ll go home to my wife and children, and they shall join me in calling for blessings upon their kind helper.” He put on his shoes, shouldered his ax, and departed.
</p>
<p>
Then the two watchers had a little dialogue.
</p>
<p>
“Now I call this the best kind of fun,” said the tutor. “Why, boy, what are you sniveling at?”
</p>
<p>
“You are sniveling, too,” said the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, both of us are sniveling,” said the tutor. “So, you see, fun may lead to sniveling as well as to laughing. Of all the pleasures of life, those are the most blessed which are expressed by tears rather than laughter.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on!” said the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Where next?” asked the tutor.
</p>
<p>
“Why, to follow him, to be sure. I want to know where they live and who they are. Do you think I will let his wife be sick and his grandchildren be hungry if I can help it? I have learned a new kind of fun, and I want more of it.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear boy, I don’t for a moment think you will stop with one good joke of this kind. Youth, with a heart like yours, never does things by halves.”
</p>
<p>
So they followed the subject of their joke to his home, and the young nobleman, by means of his well-filled purse, found means to enjoy much more of his new-found variety of fun.

<div align="center"><h2>The Journey Of Life</h2>

<p>
(From The New McGuffey Fourth Reader by William H. McGuffey, Compiler)
</p>
An Allegory
<p>
Once upon a time, a good many years ago, there was a traveler, and he set out upon a journey. It was a magic journey, and was to seem very long when he began it, and very short when he got halfway through.
</p>
<p>
He traveled along a rather dark path for some little time, without meeting anything, until at last he came to a beautiful child. So he said to the child, “What do you here?” And the child said, “I am always at play. Come and play with me.”
</p>
<p>
So he played with the child the whole day long, and they were very merry. The sky was so blue, the sun was so bright, the water was so sparkling, the leaves were so green, the flowers were so lovely, and they heard so many singing birds, and saw so many butterflies, that everything was beautiful. This was in fine weather.
</p>
<p>
When it rained, they loved to watch the falling drops and smell the fresh scents. When it blew, it was delightful to listen to the wind, and fancy what it said, as it came rushing from its home, whistling and howling, and driving the clouds before it, bending the trees, rumbling in the chimneys, shaking the house and making the sea roar in fury.
</p>
<p>
But when it snowed, that was the best of all; for they liked nothing so well as to look up at the white flakes falling fast and thick, like down from the breasts of millions of white birds, and to see how smooth and deep the drift was, and to listen to the hush upon the paths and roads.
</p>
<p>
But one day, all of a sudden, the traveler lost the child. He called to him over and over again, but got no answer. So he went on for a little while without meeting anything, until at last he came to a handsome boy. He said to the boy, “What do you hear?” And the boy said, “I am always learning. Come and learn with me.”
</p>
<p>
So he learned with the boy about Jupiter and Juno, and the Greeks and Romans,—more than I could tell, or he either; for he soon forgot a great deal of it. But they were not always learning; they had the merriest games that ever were played.
</p>
<p>
They rowed upon the river in summer, and skated on the ice in winter; they were active afoot and active on horseback; at cricket, and all games of ball; at prisoner’s base, hare-and-hounds, follow-my-leader, and more sports than I can think of: nobody could beat them. As to friends, they had such dear friends, and so many of them, that I want the time to reckon them up. They were all young, like the handsome boy, and were never to be strange to one another all their lives through.
</p>
<p>
Still, one day, in the midst of all these pleasures, the traveler lost the boy, as he had lost the child, and, after calling him in vain, went on upon his journey. So he went on for a while without seeing anything, until at last he came to a young man. He said to the young man, “What do you here?” And the young man said, “I am always in love. Come and love with me.”
</p>
<p>
But the traveler lost the young man as he had lost the rest of his friends, and, after calling to him to come back, which he never did, went on upon his journey. At last he came to a middle-aged gentleman. So he said to him, “What are you doing here?” And his answer was, “I am always busy. Come and be busy with me.”
</p>
<p>
The traveler began to be very busy with the gentleman, and they went on through the wood together. The whole journey was through a wood, only it had been open and green at first, like a wood in spring, and now began to be thick and dark, like a wood in summer; some of the little trees that had come out earliest were even turning brown.
</p>
<p>
The gentleman was not alone, but had a lady of about the same age with him, who was his wife; and they had children, who were with them too. They all went on together through the wood, cutting down the trees, and making a path among the branches, and carrying burdens and working hard.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes they came to a long green avenue that opened into deeper woods. Then they would hear a very distant little voice crying, “Father, father, I am another child! Stop for me!” And presently they would see a very little figure, growing larger as it came along, running to join them. When it came up, they all crowded round it, and kissed and welcomed it; and then they all went on together.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes they came to several avenues at once; and then they all stood still, and one of the children said, “Father, I am going to sea;” and another said, “Father, I am going to India;” and another, “Father, I am going to seek my fortune where I can;” and another, “Father, I am going to heaven.”
</p>
<p>
So, with many tears at parting, they went, solitary, down those avenues, each child upon its way; and the child who went to heaven rose into the golden air and vanished.
</p>
<p>
Whenever these partings happened, the traveler looked at the gentleman, and saw him glance up at the sky above the trees, where the day was beginning to decline, and the sunset to come on. He saw, too, that his hair was turning gray. But they could never rest long, for they had their journey to perform, and it was necessary for them to be always busy.
</p>
<p>
At last, there had been so many partings that there were no children left, and only the traveler, the gentleman, and the lady went upon their way in company. And now the wood was yellow; and now brown; and the leaves, even of the forest trees, began to fall.
</p>
<p>
They came to an avenue that was darker than the rest, and were pressing forward on their journey without looking down it, when the lady stopped.
</p>
<p>
“My husband,” said the lady, “I am called.”
</p>
<p>
They listened, and they heard a voice a long way down the avenue say, “Mother, mother!”
</p>
<p>
It was the voice of the child who had said, “I am going to heaven!” and the father cried, “I pray not yet. The sunset is very near. I pray not yet.”
</p>
<p>
But the voice called, “Mother, mother!” without minding him, though his hair was now quite white, and tears were on his face.
</p>
<p>
Then the mother, who was already drawn into the shade of the dark avenue, and moving away with her arms still around his neck, kissed him and said, “My dearest, I am summoned, and I go!” And she was gone. The traveler and he were left alone together.
</p>
<p>
And they went on and on, until they came very near to the end of the wood; so near, that they could see the setting sun shining red before them through the trees.
</p>
<p>
Yet once more, while he broke his way among the branches, the traveler lost his friend. He called and called, but there was no reply, and when he passed out of the wood and saw the peaceful sun going down upon a wide purple prospect, he came to an old man sitting upon a fallen tree. He said to the old man, “What do you here?” And the old man said, with a calm smile, “I am always remembering. Come and remember with me.”
</p>
<p>
So the traveler sat down by the side of the old man, face to face with the serene sunset; and all his friends came softly back and stood around him. The beautiful child, the handsome boy, the young man, the father, mother, and children every one of them was there, and he had lost nothing. He loved them all, and was kind and forbearing with them all, and they all honored and loved him.

<div align="center"><h2>Snow-flakes</h2>
<p>
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
<P>
Out of the bosom of the Air,
Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,
Over the woodlands brown and bare,
Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
Silent, and soft, and slow
Descends the snow.
</P>
<P>
Even as our cloudy fancies take
Suddenly shape in some divine expression,
Even as the troubled heart doth make
In the white countenance confession,
The troubled sky reveals
The grief it feels.
</P>
<P>
This is the poem of the air,
Slowly in silent syllables recorded;
This is the secret of despair,
Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,
Now whispered and revealed
To wood and field.
